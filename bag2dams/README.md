The `bag2dams` utility goes here. It consumes a Beanbag package, authenticates 
to an ERMrest store, and makes one or more entity POST or PUT requests to load
the data from the Beanbag package. It also loads the assets to a Hatrac store.

## Installation

From this directory, run:

`python setup.py install`
